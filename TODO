# TODO

* properly compute chunk CRC values in the pngcreate utility
* report total file size in pnginfo output
* display ancillary chunk information such as comments, gamma data, etc. in
  the pnginfo output
* provide hints in the pnginfo output about image improvement such as whether
  the image should be indexed
* analyze space (memory) and time performance during encoding/decoding
* create an optimization utility that can apply optimizations to a PNG such as
  reducing or increasing its bit depth, changing its size, etc.
